    "\n",
    "The Interactigen module is built on LangChain.  The decision to use LangChain enables experimenting with various models with minimal code adjustments.  Already have code to load and configure your favourite LangChain ChatModel?  Great!  Let's use that.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output results for each run is a JSON array for downstream use: write to a file, split test/train utterances, and more."
